                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language for creating a webpage. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser.
                They can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video.
                HTML is used to mark and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can display them correctly.
                HTML also adds meta information to a webpage.</p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the preferred way for setting the look and feel of a website.
                The style sheets define the colour, size and position of text and other HTML tags, while the HTML files define the content and how it is organised.
                Separating them allows you to change the colour scheme without having to rewrite your entire web site.</p>

                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development.
                It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. 
                While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMA Script, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
                However this website has no javascript framework.</p>
